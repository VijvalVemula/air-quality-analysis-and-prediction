# Air Quality Analysis Project

## Overview
This project utilizes Apache Spark to perform detailed analysis on air quality data. The primary focus is on exploring and processing measurements of pollutants to derive insights and understand temporal pollution trends.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8
- Apache Spark 3.5.0

## Dataset
The dataset, `air-quality-data.csv`, includes multiple air quality indicators such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Measurements are timestamped, providing a comprehensive view of the data across various times of the day.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing using Spark DataFrames.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies.
- Data visualization to depict the findings and patterns in pollution levels.
- Model development to predict future pollution levels based on historical data.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Environment Setup
Ensure Java and Spark are correctly installed and configured:
```
apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless -qq > /dev/null
wget -q https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.5.0/spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz
tar xf spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz
```

### 2. Python Dependencies
Install necessary Python libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launching the Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook and open `analysis-and-prediction.ipynb`:

## Running the Analysis
Execute the cells sequentially to perform data loading, EDA, visualization, and modeling.
